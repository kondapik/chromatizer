Chromatizer enables you to visualize music in realtime using python, a ESP8266 or Raspberry Pi and WS28xx addressable LEDs. This was created as part of a personal project inspired by [Scott Lawson's Audio reactive LED strip](https://github.com/scottlawsonbc/audio-reactive-led-strip), to explore the intersection of music and technology.
